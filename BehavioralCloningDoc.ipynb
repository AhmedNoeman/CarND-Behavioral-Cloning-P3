    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable\n",
    "\n",
    "The Model.ipynb file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model uses the well-known Nvidia CNN architecture for end to end learning for self-driving cars which can be found in [this paper](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf) with slight modifications to match the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes ELU layers to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "My model consists of a convolution neural network with 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 32 and 128 (Model.ipynb lines 145-160) \n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code lines 149-153), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 148). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains 1 dropout layer in order to reduce overfitting (Model.ipynb lines 155). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 180-182). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (Model.ipynb line 185).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road ... \n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to test different well know models such as LeNet and Nvidia.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model as simple as 1 convulution layer and 1 fully connected layer just to make ensure the whole pipeline is intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, I have tried LeNet, which was perfectly robust and smooth in straight lines and slight curves, but failed to predict the correct angle in sharp curves (as the one after the bridge).\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce more complexity in the model, I have implemented the Nvidia architecture. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. To combat the overfitting, I modified the model by adding a dropout layer with keep probability 0.5. The dropout was after the flatten layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track, such as the same curve after the bridge where the car drove with the right wheels over the curb.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road and at full throttle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture (Model.ipynb lines 145-160) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Layer             || Output              || Parameter  || Connected to            | \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior, I used the data set provided by udacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To augment the data set, I used the side cameras images with adding correction value.\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 0.15% of the data into a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 30 and 8 for the batch size. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary."
